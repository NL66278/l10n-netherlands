Dutch reference accounting chart

This module contains the chart based on the "Referentie Grootboek Schema (RGS)"
===============================================================================

The RGS chart of accounts has been developed by the tax authorities,
accountants and software developers to standardize the chart of account used
in companies, or alternatively, to link existing chart of accounts to the
reference one, in order to facilitate data exchange and reporting.

Unlike in many other countries, in the Netherlands organisations have near
complete freedom in the setup of their chart of accounts. This made reporting
and data exchange difficult. The RGS provides both an attempt at
standardization, or at least provides a way to translate the data in one chart
of accounts to the reference.

This module can be used for both purposes.
